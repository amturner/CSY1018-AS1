            <h2>Jobs</h2>
            <p>In the field of Web Development, there are many different roles that Web Developers can take on. Ranging from Front End Web Development to Back End Web Development, or even to Full Stack Web Development, Web Developers have a decent amount of flexibility. However, even with this flexibility, there are some things which all Web Developers should take into consideration when looking for jobs.</p>

            <p>In order to help illustrate this, on this page, I have chosen two different Web Development jobs, both of which are from different companies, that I can use to compare against each other. After reading the description of each job role, you will find a comparison of both roles, alongside a short summary of any findings made as a result of this comparison.</p>

            <h3 class="no-border center-heading">Front End Web Developer <i>(Latcom plc)</i></h3>
            
            <figure class="image">

            </figure>

            <p>After performing a quick search for Front End Web Developer jobs on Glassdoor, I found that this particular role was rather basic in terms of the skills that they expect from potential applicants. Based in Northamptonshire, United Kingdom, Latcom plc were looking for a Front End Web Developer, where if successful, applicants would be responsible for the “Delivery of web design and development projects, specifically relating to front end elements of a build”.</p>

            <p>Taking a look at the skills that Latcom plc expect applicants to this role to have, they expect that applicants have:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>At least 2 years' experience in a similar role.</li>
                <li>Good working knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</li>
                <li>Strong skills in working with frameworks such as Bootstrap and AngularJS.</li>
                <li>The ability to both design and implement responsive user interfaces.</li>
                <li>Experience with software in the Adobe Creative Suite. (E.g. Photoshop, Illustrator)</li>
                <li>Experience with building and maintaining SQL databases.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>As this list of skills suggests, Web Developers applying for this role, whilst expected to have some experience in Web Development, are not required, if at all, to have in-depth experience in Back End Web Development. Alongside this, as applicants are described to be working on “front end elements”, this means that successful applicants would only be limited to doing Front End Web Development.</p>

            <p>According to the job listing, the potential salary for successful applicants in this role is expected to be somewhere between £20,000 and £25,000.</p>

            <h3 class="no-border">Full Stack Web Developer <i>(Jonothan Bosworth Recruitment Specialists)</i></h3>

            <figure class="image">
                <img src="images/jobs/fullstackwebdev-jonothanbosworth.jpg" alt="MDN Web Docs Home Page">
                <figcaption>The Home Page for MDN Web Docs.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>Through Glassdoor, I had also decided to look for Full Stack Web Development jobs, mainly to see how these types of jobs compare to sole Front End or Back End Web Development jobs. For this particular job role, Jonothan Bosworth Recruitment Specialists, which is a company based in Milton Keynes, United Kingdom, were looking for a Full Stack Web Developer to add to their team in order to assist in the development of both internal web applications and external web applications as requested by clients.</p>

            <p>Taking a look at the skills that Jonothan Bosworth Recruitment Specialists expect potential applicants to have, it is clear that they greatly differ from that of a Front End Web Developer. These skills include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Experience in using C#, SQL and Sass, in addition to other languages, such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</li>
                <li>Experience in using frameworks such as Bootstrap and AngularJS.</li>
                <li>Experience in using JQuery and JSON.</li>
                <li>Experience with ASP.NET MVC v4 and v5. </li>
            </ul>

            <p>As this list of skills suggests, Web Developers applying for this role would be required to have more in-depth experience, not only with Front End languages such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript and frameworks like Bootstrap and AngularJS, but also with Back End specific languages such as C# and SQL.</p>

            <p>To reflect this, according to this specific job listing, the potential salary for successful applicants in this role would be somewhere around £50,000.</p>

            <h3 class="no-border">Comparison</h3>
            <p>After looking over both of these jobs roles, it was clear that there was some notable differences between them, both in terms of the skills that are required when applying, and in terms of the salary that each respective role offers. For instance, when looking back at the Front End Developer job role, it is clear the skills that are provided on the job listing are rather basic, with applicants only needing a “good” level of knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and only two years experience in the field, amongst other aspects.</p>

            <p>When looking at the Full Stack Web Developer job role, however, it is clear that, when in comparison to the Front End Web Developer role, the skills that are required are more advanced. Whilst both job roles do share some common elements, such as requiring applicants to have prior knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, a Full Stack Developer for this specific role would also need to have a high level of knowledge in working with other languages such as C# and SQL, alongside having knowledge in using Microsoft’s ASP.NET MVC web application framework.</p>

            <p>Alongside these clear differences in the skills that are required for each job role, it is also clear that the salaries offered by each job role reflect that. For example, for the Front End Web Developer job role, the salary offered is in the range of £20,000 to £25,000, whilst for the Full Stack Web Developer job role, the salary offered is close to around £50,000.</p>

            <p>What this essentially tells us is that the less experience that a Web Developer has, the lesser amount of money that a Web Developer would make in a job role, whilst if they have more experience, they would most likely earn a higher amount.</p>

            <p>To help give a clearer comparison, I have included a table below listing the key differences in both job roles:</p>

            <h3 class="no-border">Summary</h3>

            <p>In summary, after comparing both the Front End Web Developer and Full Stack Web Developer job roles, there are some important details to take away from this comparison. When looking at the Front End Web Developer job role, with basic level of knowledge that is required from applicants, alongside the lower annual salary, it is clear that a job role in Front End Web Development would mostly be suited for developers who are in the early days of their career. Through this job role, not only would this give them the opportunity to gain experience of working in a web development-related job role, but it would also give them the opportunity to further expand their skillset.</p>

            <p>When looking back at the Full Stack Web Developer role, with the more advanced level of knowledge that is required from applicants and the higher annual salary, it is clear that a job role in Full Stack Web Development is instead mostly suited for developers who have a lot of experience in both Front End and Back End Web Development. Even though this is the case, however, Full Stack Web Developers may still seek to further expand their skillset, or still make an effort to keep up-to-date with the latest developments in web development.</p>
